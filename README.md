# FlickerPublicPhotos

Notes:
There's no Pagination - All the usernames I've randomly tried had less photos than the default 100 that come in a request so, to save time, I didn't implement pagination
There's no tests - No time to write them
The architecture seems a little weird, as it is fully built on closures, however performance-wise it runs smoothly on an iPhone 4S, as expected - No time for a proper refactor to turn it to mvvm.

Usernames I've tried and contain several pictures:
"username"
"Rui Peres"
"gogogo"

but there's a lot of them, just try some random string.
